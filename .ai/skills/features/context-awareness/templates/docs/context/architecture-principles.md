# Architecture Principles

> Project-wide constraints and conventions. Each principle is a standing rule,
> not a one-time decision. Update or mark as superseded when the rule changes.

## How to maintain

1. Add a new section under **Principles** when a cross-cutting rule is established.
2. If a principle is superseded, keep it with a `[SUPERSEDED by ...]` tag — do not delete.
3. When an alternative approach is evaluated and rejected, record it under **Rejected Approaches** with the reason.
4. After editing, run `node .ai/skills/features/context-awareness/scripts/ctl-context.mjs touch` to update checksums.
