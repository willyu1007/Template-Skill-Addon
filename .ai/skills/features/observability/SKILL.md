# Observability Feature

## Intent

Make observability contracts explicit and reviewable:

- Metrics registry
- Logs schema
- Tracing conventions

The Observability feature integrates with Context Awareness by placing contracts under `docs/context/observability/`.

## What gets enabled

When enabled, the feature materializes:

- `docs/context/observability/**`
- `observability/**` (configuration and runbooks)

Controller script (provided by the template SSOT):

- `node .ai/skills/features/observability/scripts/obsctl.mjs` — manage and verify observability contracts

## Dependency

- **Context Awareness** SHOULD be enabled.
  - This feature assumes `docs/context/` exists (observability contracts live under `docs/context/observability/`).

## How to enable

1. Ensure Context Awareness is already enabled (`docs/context/` exists).
2. Copy templates from:
   - `.ai/skills/features/observability/templates/`
   into the repo root.
3. Initialize:

```bash
node .ai/skills/features/observability/scripts/obsctl.mjs init
node .ai/skills/features/observability/scripts/obsctl.mjs verify
```

Optional (recommended for LLM routing): record the flag in project state:

```bash
node .ai/scripts/projectctl.mjs init
node .ai/scripts/projectctl.mjs set features.observability true
```

## Verification

```bash
node .ai/skills/features/observability/scripts/obsctl.mjs verify
```

## Boundaries

- No secrets in repo.
- Treat `docs/context/observability/**` as a contract surface: changes should be deliberate and reviewed.
