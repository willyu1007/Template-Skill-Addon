# Style Frontend UI

## Purpose
Create consistent UI styling that is easy to maintain and scales with the codebase.

## When to use
Use this skill when you are:
- Styling new components or pages
- Refactoring inconsistent styles
- Introducing theme tokens (spacing, colors, typography)
- Standardizing layout utilities and responsive patterns

## Inputs
- UI kit or styling solution used by the codebase (CSS modules, styled components, theme system, etc.)
- Design requirements (spacing scale, typography, breakpoints)
- Accessibility constraints (contrast, focus states)

## Outputs
- A styling approach decision for the component/feature
- Theme-token usage (where supported)
- Reusable style primitives (layout components, utility classes)

## Rules
- Styling MUST follow a single primary approach for consistency.
- Theme tokens SHOULD be used instead of hardcoded values where available.
- Components MUST have accessible focus states and sufficient contrast.
- Responsive behavior SHOULD be explicit and testable.

## Step-by-step workflow
1. Choose the styling method consistent with the codebase.
2. Identify reusable style tokens (spacing, typography).
3. Implement component styles with:
   - predictable naming
   - minimal duplication
4. Verify:
   - keyboard navigation and focus
   - responsive layout for common breakpoints

## Included assets
- Templates: `./templates/` includes a style object pattern and token checklist.
- Examples: `./examples/` includes a consistent component style pattern.
