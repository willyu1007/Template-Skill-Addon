# Perform Web Research

## Purpose
Produce high-signal research outputs that are actionable and evidence-backed, without over-relying on low-quality sources.

## When to use
Use this skill when:
- You need up-to-date information (APIs, specs, releases, regulations)
- You must compare options (libraries, services, standards)
- You need citations for a technical or product decision
- You suspect prior knowledge may be outdated

## Inputs
- Research question(s) and decision context
- Constraints (time, allowed sources, required recency)
- Definitions of success (what the output must enable)

## Outputs
- A cited summary answering the question
- A short list of recommended actions or options (if applicable)
- A log of key sources and why they were trusted

## Source selection rules
- Prefer primary sources:
  - official documentation
  - standards bodies
  - release notes
  - peer-reviewed papers
- Use reputable secondary sources only when needed to interpret.
- Treat low-quality sources as last resort and label them clearly.

## Workflow
1. Clarify the question and required freshness.
2. Identify 3–5 primary sources as anchors.
3. Extract facts and constraints; avoid assumptions.
4. Cross-check conflicting claims across multiple sources.
5. Produce a decision-oriented write-up:
   - what is true
   - what is uncertain
   - what to do next

## Included assets
- Templates: `./templates/` includes a research brief and evidence table format.
