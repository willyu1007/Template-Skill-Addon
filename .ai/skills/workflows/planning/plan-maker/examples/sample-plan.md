# Add Feature Flag for New Checkout - Implementation Plan

## Goal
- Introduce a feature flag to safely roll out the new checkout flow to a subset of users, with a clean rollback path.

## Non-goals
- Rewrite the checkout architecture
- Change payment provider integrations

## Open questions and assumptions
### Open questions (answer before execution)
- Q1: Which feature-flag system should be used (existing internal service vs third-party)?
- Q2: What are the success metrics for ramping to 100% (conversion, error rate, latency)?

### Assumptions (if unanswered)
- A1: We already have a feature-flag provider and client library available in the codebase (risk: medium)

## Scope and impact
- Affected areas/modules: checkout UI, checkout API entry points
- External interfaces/APIs: none (flagged behavior only)
- Data/storage impact: minimal (flag evaluation only)
- Backward compatibility: old checkout remains default until ramped

## Milestones
1. **Milestone 1**: Flag scaffolding exists
   - Deliverable: flag created + client wiring + default OFF behavior
   - Acceptance criteria: no behavior change when flag is OFF; builds/tests green
2. **Milestone 2**: New checkout behind flag
   - Deliverable: routing + UI + API switches are flag-controlled
   - Acceptance criteria: can enable flag for a test cohort; smoke tests pass
3. **Milestone 3**: Rollout controls and monitoring
   - Deliverable: ramp plan + dashboards/alerts
   - Acceptance criteria: clear rollback procedure; monitoring confirms stability

## Step-by-step plan (phased)

### Phase 0 - Discovery
- Objective: Confirm existing flag provider and integration points
- Deliverables:
  - List of current flag usage locations
  - Decision: flag key/name + rollout strategy
- Verification:
  - Confirm flag can be evaluated in both frontend and backend
- Rollback:
  - N/A

### Phase 1 - Flag scaffolding
- Objective: Create the flag and wire evaluation
- Deliverables:
  - Feature flag defined with default OFF
  - Minimal wiring to evaluate the flag where routing occurs
- Verification:
  - Existing checkout remains unchanged with flag OFF
  - Unit tests for flag evaluation paths
- Rollback:
  - Revert wiring commit; flag can remain unused

### Phase 2 - Gate the new checkout
- Objective: Ensure all user-visible switches are flag-controlled
- Deliverables:
  - Conditional routing to new checkout when flag ON
  - Safe fallback to old checkout on error
- Verification:
  - Smoke test old checkout (flag OFF)
  - Smoke test new checkout (flag ON)
  - Error handling validated
- Rollback:
  - Disable flag globally; revert conditional routing if needed

### Phase 3 - Rollout and monitoring
- Objective: Ramp safely with metrics and rollback
- Deliverables:
  - Rollout schedule (1% → 10% → 50% → 100%)
  - Monitoring plan and alert thresholds
- Verification:
  - Ramp steps have go/no-go criteria
  - On-call/rollback steps documented
- Rollback:
  - Immediate flag disable; revert deployments if systemic issues

## Verification and acceptance criteria
- Automated tests: unit + integration relevant to checkout routing
- Manual checks: end-to-end purchase flow smoke test
- Acceptance criteria:
  - No regression in conversion/error rate at each ramp step
  - Rollback can be executed within minutes

## Risks and mitigations
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Detection | Rollback |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|---|
| Flag provider not available on backend | medium | high | add backend flag client or proxy | integration test | disable flag / revert |
| Partial gating causes inconsistent state | low | high | centralize routing decision | e2e tests | disable flag |

## Optional detailed documentation layout (convention)
If a detailed bundle is required, create:

```
dev/active/<task>/dev-docs/
  00-overview.md
  01-plan.md
  02-architecture.md
  03-implementation-notes.md
  04-verification.md
```

## To-dos
- [ ] Confirm flag system and rollout capability
- [ ] Confirm success metrics and dashboards
- [ ] Confirm rollout schedule and owners
