# Stage B: Project blueprint

> **SSOT**: For the complete command reference, see `init/skills/initialize-project-from-requirements/SKILL.md`.

Stage B produces and validates a **project blueprint** that will drive Stage C scaffolding, config generation, and skill pack selection.

> **Working location**: `init/project-blueprint.json` (created by the `start` command)
> 
> **Final location**: `docs/project/project-blueprint.json` (archived by `cleanup-init --archive`)

Reference templates:
- `init/skills/initialize-project-from-requirements/templates/project-blueprint.example.json`
- `init/skills/initialize-project-from-requirements/templates/project-blueprint.schema.json`

---

## What must be true before leaving Stage B

1. `init/project-blueprint.json` exists and is properly configured
2. The blueprint passes validation:
   - schema-level sanity checks
   - pack selection recommendation report (optional, but strongly recommended)
3. The user explicitly approves the blueprint (checkpoint)

---

## Validate blueprint

From repo root:

```bash
node init/skills/initialize-project-from-requirements/scripts/init-pipeline.cjs validate \
  --repo-root .
```

Optional: show recommended packs and whether they are installed:

```bash
node init/skills/initialize-project-from-requirements/scripts/init-pipeline.cjs suggest-packs \
  --repo-root .
```

## State tracking (recommended)

After reviewing `skills.packs`, record the review in `init/.init-state.json`:

```bash
node init/skills/initialize-project-from-requirements/scripts/init-pipeline.cjs review-packs --repo-root .
```

---

## Technology stack selection

The blueprint must specify technology-stack related fields:

### `repo` fields

```json
{
  "repo": {
    "layout": "single",           // or "monorepo"
    "language": "typescript",     // language
    "packageManager": "pnpm"      // package manager
  }
}
```

### Supported languages

| Language | Has built-in template | Recommended package manager |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| typescript | ✅ | pnpm |
| javascript | ✅ | pnpm |
| go | ✅ | go |
| python | ❌ (LLM-generated) | poetry |
| java | ❌ (LLM-generated) | gradle |
| dotnet | ❌ (LLM-generated) | dotnet |
| other | ❌ (LLM-generated) | - |

For languages without built-in templates, the `apply` command will print guidance and the LLM should generate config files based on `templates/llm-init-guide.md`.

### LLM guidance

If you're using an AI assistant to guide initialization, refer to:
- Module E in `templates/conversation-prompts.md` (technology stack selection)
- Phase 2 and Phase 5 in `templates/llm-init-guide.md`

---

## Add-on flags (optional)

If you want to enable the context-awareness add-on, set:
- `addons.contextAwareness: true`

Optional:
- `context.mode: "contract" | "snapshot"` (default: `contract`)

`context.*` is configuration only and does not trigger installation.

Note: Stage C `apply` will attempt to install the add-on payload from:
- `addons/context-awareness/payload/` (default; can be overridden via `apply --addons-root`)

---

## User approval checkpoint (advance to Stage C)

After the user explicitly approves the blueprint, record approval and advance:

```bash
node init/skills/initialize-project-from-requirements/scripts/init-pipeline.cjs approve --stage B --repo-root .
```

---

## Note on blueprint location

The blueprint is stored in `init/project-blueprint.json` during initialization. After Stage C completion, use `cleanup-init --archive` to archive it to `docs/project/project-blueprint.json` for long-term retention.
