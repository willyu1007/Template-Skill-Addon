description: Project hub synchronizer and validator. Scans the repo (including multiple dev-docs roots), validates project/task metadata against the Project Contract, repairs drift by generating missing task identity meta (.ai-task.yaml) and regenerating derived views, and enforces complete task-feature mapping plus LLM-authored semantic extraction for feature-level governance.
